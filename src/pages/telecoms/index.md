## exchanges
geosciences australia provides [a dataset](https://services.ga.gov.au/gis/rest/services/Telephone_Exchanges/MapServer) with the locations of (approximately)  every telephone exchange in australia.

the dataset is provided as an ArcGIS REST service, which makes it slightly tricker to get all the data at once.

## payphones
telstra provides the &ldquo;[Telstra Payphone Register](https://www.telstra.com.au/consumer-advice/payphones#service)&rdquo; as an Excel file, and [an online tool to locate payphones](https://www.telstra.com.au/find-us?search=payphone).

neither are quite perfect. the payphone register appears to be infrequently updated, but provides slightly more information than the map. the map is difficult to use on mobile and can only be filtered by location and not by (for example) mobile/landline or the presence of a TTY.
