## exchanges
geosciences australia provides [a dataset](https://services.ga.gov.au/gis/rest/services/Telephone_Exchanges/MapServer) with the locations of ~every telephone exchange in australia. unfortunately, the dataset is provided as an ArcGIS REST service.

we've scraped the data and converted it to a [gpx file](/telecoms/exchanges.gpx).
