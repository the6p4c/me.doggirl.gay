# turning chains

- basically every pattern worked in rows calls for a specific number of chains at the end of each row, before beginning to work back into the previous row

when working in rows, at least one chain is required at the end of each row to physically allow the hook to reach the last stitch of the previous row. the number of chains you make is usually determined by what stitches you're working into the row, such that your height above the work after working your turning chains matches that of the first stitch of the new row.

- **working sc in rows?** use one turning chain
- **working dc in rows?** use two turning chains
- **working tr in rows?** use three turning chains
- **working something else in rows?** use as many chains as you need to equalise height

if the first row is worked into chains, the first row's turning chains are often included in the base number of chains of the pattern. for example, working into the 2nd chain from the hook "produces" one turning chain (suitable for an sc), and working into the 3rd chain from the hook "produces" two turning chains (suitable for a dc).

- some patterns worked into a magic ring call for a specific number of chains before the first stitch into the magic ring

when working into a magic ring, there isn't as much to force you to chain before working into the ring. the height of the initial loop is already reasonably well matched to the height of a single crochet, so the first single crochet worked into a magic ring doesn't deform. when working taller stitches, it's a bit more of a problem, and adding an extra chain or two can help to maintain the shape of the first stitch.

since the height is already well matched for an sc, i've found that you can get away with one less chain than would be required when working in rows.

- **working sc in a magic ring?** don't use any chains
- **working dc in a magic ring?** use one chain
- **working tr in a magic ring?** use two chains
- **working something else in a magic ring?** use as many chains as you need to equalise height

whether the chains themselves are considered a stitch (and should be worked into in subsequent rows/rounds) or are ignored (and just act to equalise height) is pretty inconsistent between patterns.

- chains can be used to create pseudo-stitches without working into a stitch
