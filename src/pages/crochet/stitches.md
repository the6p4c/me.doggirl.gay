# stitches

## blanket stitch
### pattern
- ch `3n`
- **row 1:** skip 2 ch, [dc 2], (skip 2 ch, \[sc, dc 2]) repeat `n - 2` times, sc
- **row 2&ndash;&infin;:** ch 2 and turn. [dc 2], (skip 2 st, \[sc, dc 2]) repeat `n - 2` times, sc into turning ch space

## wattle stitch
### pattern
- ch `3n`
- **row 1:** (skip 2 ch, \[sc, ch, dc]) repeat `n - 1` times, skip 2 ch, sc
- **row 2&ndash;&infin;:** ch 1 and turn. working into ch spaces from previous row, [sc, ch, dc] repeat `n - 1` times, working into turning chain of previous row, sc

### concept
- each row starts with an sc and ends with an sc
  - in the first row, the first sc is faked with a chain
- to keep the number of stitches in each row constant, we skip two stitches after working three stitches into the same chain space
- the three stitch bases in each chain space create an alternating left and right diagonal pattern across the fabric
- the final dc in each chain space gives the stitch enough height to make the leap over the two skipped stitches
